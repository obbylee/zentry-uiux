### ðŸ“š Learning & Acknowledgments

This project is a direct result of the incredible learning resources provided by **jsmastery.pro** and **Adrian Hajdin ([@adrianhajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin))**.

Completed as part of an online course to deepen my understanding of GSAP. Key concepts learned include:

- **GSAP & React Integration**: Learning the modern, efficient approach of using the useGSAP hook to manage GSAP animations within a React application's lifecycle, ensuring proper cleanup and preventing memory leaks.

- **Scroll-Based Animation**: Mastering the GSAP ScrollTrigger plugin to create interactive scroll effects, such as pinning elements and tying animations directly to scroll progress (`scrub`).

- **Advanced UI Animations**: Implementing sophisticated visual effects, including:

  - Responsive, tilt-based animations that follow the mouse cursor.

  - Sequencing Animations: Using `gsap.timeline` to create powerful, sequenced animations that tell a story.

  - Performance optimization for animation-heavy pages.
